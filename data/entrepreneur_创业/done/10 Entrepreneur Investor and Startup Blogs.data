summary:These are blogs that you should keep an eye on often as an entrepreneur.

--text follows this line--
__Paul Graham's Essays__

Paul Graham's essays are great because they will make you think, and you will find yourself coming back to re-read them and learning new things as your own context changes. I particularly like "Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas" and "How Not to Die".

__A VC__

Fred Wilson is a very successful VC, but he has been an interesting blogger for even longer than that. Covers a broad range of topics for entrepreneurs, and also shares interesting opinion and insights around his own investments.

Some to the best stuff happens in the comments, and he is very accessible.

__Marco.org - by Marco Arment__

Always getting the conversation going, Marco is fun to follow along with as an entrepreneur and as a writer. Also, check out The Magazine - his iOS Newsstand publication.

__Archives - Venture Hacks__

Venture Hacks is less a blog and more a resource, since it isn't updated as regularly anymore. It is brought to you by Nivi and Naval, the same two fellows who created AngelList, and is full of help advice for raising money as a startup founder.

__Chris Dixon__

Entrepreneur turned VC, it was recently announced that Chris will be moving to the Bay Area from New York to join Andreessen Horowitz as a partner. He has no problem being controversial, saying what everyone else is thinking, and his posts are consistently thought provoking.

__The Bessemer Blog | Bessemer Venture Partners__

Bessemer Venture Partners recently started blogging (check out the updated website too!), and my friend Ethan's post "Developer-Focused Businesses Are Where Itâ€™s At" is my favorite so far. This is in my one to watch list, we'll see how it goes as a new blog is always tough, but I'm excited to see what's next.

__Scripting News by David Winer__

Started in 1997, and probably one of the longest running blogs I've followed by one of the most dedicated bloggers. Find some posts annoying, but the other half are good enough that it is worth it to keep reading. He loves the idea of reinventing press, so I feel like Referly is right up his alley for magazines. Has made many many contributions to the web as we know it today.

__Lessons Learned__

Eric is most well known for "The Lean Startup" but he was blogging long before that, and his articles go back to 2008. As a former entrepreneur turned full-time author and advisor to companies he has seen a lot. Check out his definition of "Minimum Viable Product".

__Steve Blank__

Father of the lean startup movement, but more importantly a really thoughtful guy who loves entrepreneurship and teaching. Read his books but also read his older stuff, particularly "The Secret History of Silicon Valley".

__Mark Suster - Both Sides of The Table__

Bringing a mix of Hollywood and Silicon Valley flavor, this L.A. based VC writes straight from the heart and his firsthand experience as an entrepreneur.
