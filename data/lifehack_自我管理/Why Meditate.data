summary:We become more aware when we become distracted by meditation.

“Meditation […]  is based upon the principle of knowing what the mind can handle and what it cannot and then increasing its ability to handle more.”  __Sakyong Mipham__

Almost weekly there is a new hot Todo list app or a new productivity method.  Many bloggers, authors and hackers have marked their territory in this space and audiences follow.  I certainly use some of these techniques and know the value in systematizing your productivity. This is one area I’m going to leave to those specialists and rather focus on techniques which directly affect the mind and body. Specifically we are going to look at what affects our ability to focus.  

Even before we had social networks, mobile devices, email, and news to provide us with constant distractions many spiritual leaders noted the mind’s natural propensity for distraction.  Buddhism was the primary spiritual path which directly explored the techniques to quite the mind.  In the future I will go in to more depth on why the Buddah and his followers did this and what it means for us but for now lets just start with the basics.

Meditation can be viewed essentially as the practice of training your mind to be aware.  Through meditation we increase our awareness of everything the mind is focused on and distracted by. We become more aware when we become distracted allowing us to catch that distraction and re-center our focus where we want it. 

Meditation also allows us to be more aware of more subtle aspects of our work.  One area I find is that I’m more aware of what is really motivating my actions.  So instead of taking an action based on a motivation that I don’t want to drive my work (i.e., ego, jealousy, attention-seeking) I can see that and take more actions with motivations  more aligned to the goals I am seeking (i.e., helping others, creating, exploring ideas). 

These are two ways the mind is able to handle more.

In my next post we are going to discuss how to get started with meditation and what to expect from your work by incorporating this practice.
