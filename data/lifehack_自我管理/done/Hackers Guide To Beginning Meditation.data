In the previous post I walked through a couple outcomes a hacker, builder or artist will achieve through meditation.  In this post I’m going to provide a very basic guide to the beginning meditation.

Start by getting a chair and a clock or timer. Find a room where you won’t be distracted.

1. Sit upright in the chair with your back upright and not resting on the chair.
2. Set the timer for 15 minutes for your initial meditation.
Place your hands gently palms down on your legs and close your eyes.  Make sure your shoulders are slightly back and you are not slouching. 
3. Focus on the feeling of the air moving in-and-out of your nose as you breath.  This breathing sensation will be the object of your meditation.
4. For the next 15 minutes try to maintain your focus on your breath.  Once you realize your mind has wandered off notice it and bring it back to your breath.  Keep bringing your focus back to your breath until the 15 minutes has passed.
5. You will be unable to keep your focus on your breath for more than a few seconds at a time.  This is normal.  It is our first step at seeing how active our mind is and the recognition of this and the gentle refocusing of your mind back to the breath is the main thing you need to focus on.

Try also to maintain your posture even if you get soreness.  Most of us who spend long hours hunched in front of a computer are going to take some time to develop a better posture and stronger muscles to hold us in that posture. 

Once you have done your first 15 minute meditation try and maintain the gentle and calm mind as you move back in to your daily activities.  Try not to jump right back in to distraction (like Hacker News or email) but use your focus on a single task which needs to be complete. This is how we start to connect the practice of meditation to the rest of our lives. 

For the next week try and do two of these 15 minute meditations a day.  You are building up the foundation of your mindfulness practice though this.  Continue to focus on the breath during these sessions.  After you have done the two 15 minute sessions a day for a week move to one 30 minute session.  As you have more a more practice you will find that you will be able to maintain focus for longer and longer periods.  You will also find that your focus and calmness on other activities outside of meditation will also improve.

In a future post I will talk about more these techniques in more depth and how to continue to transfer your mindfulness practice to the rest of your work.
