summary:Inspiration doesn’t exist; only true work, grinding away, is real.

Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” he replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp.” - The War of Art, Steven Pressfield

__I used to wait for inspiration__. But inspiration is always late. Sitting nervously, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. Is it here yet? No, I don’t think so. I’ll just wait a little bit longer.

Inspiration is made up. It’s a self-defeating act of resistance, holding us back from success. From being a creator. Write a blog post without inspiration? Hah. A painting? No, no. Once I’m inspired, I’ll do it right away.

Inspiration is procrastination in a bad disguise. The dream of being great. It’s a taste of success. And it leaves you wanting more. Craving the next short-lived visit. It keeps you believing, riding the procrastination train.

### Make your own damn inspiration

I’m tired of being stood up. I’ve been waiting for weeks and inspiration isn’t showing up. And to break free? I just need to stop believing the lie. It’s in my head. Made up. __Success handcuffs.__

Wanna know how to make your inspiration? Start working on that _thing_. Even when you don’t want to. Everyday. Even when you’re scared of it. Seriously. Stop what you’re doing right now. Do your life’s work.
